\arguments{
\item{hrf}{An object of class \code{HRF}.}

\item{h}{Numeric vector of length \code{nbasis(hrf)} giving the weights.}

\item{...}{Reserved for future extensions.}

\item{name}{Optional name for the resulting HRF.}
}

A new \code{HRF} object with \code{nbasis = 1}.
}
\description{
Create a new HRF by linearly weighting the basis functions of an existing HRF.
This is useful for turning estimated basis coefficients into a single
functional HRF.

Create a new HRF by linearly weighting the basis functions of an existing HRF.
Useful when coefficients have been estimated for an FIR/bspline/SPMG3 basis
and one wants a single functional HRF.
