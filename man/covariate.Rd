\title{Construct a Covariate Term}
\usage{
covariate(..., data, id = NULL, prefix = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{A variable argument set of covariate names.}

\item{data}{A data.frame containing the variables.}

\item{id}{An optional identifier for the covariate term.}

\item{prefix}{An optional prefix to add to the covariate names.}
}
\value{
A list containing information about the covariate term with class
'covariatespec' that can be used within an event_model.
}
\description{
Creates a covariate term that is added directly to the fMRI model without being convolved
with a hemodynamic response function (HRF). This is useful for including nuisance variables,
continuous covariates, or any other regressors that should not undergo HRF convolution.
}
\details{
In fMRI analysis, some predictors should not be convolved with the HRF because they
represent:
\itemize{
\item Continuous physiological measurements (e.g., heart rate, respiration)
\item Motion parameters from head movement correction
\item Scanner drift or other technical artifacts
\item Behavioral measures that directly correlate with BOLD signal
\item Global signal or other nuisance variables
}

The covariate term can be combined with standard HRF-convolved event terms in the
same model. For example:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{model <- event_model(signal ~ hrf(stimulus) + covariate(motion_x, motion_y), 
                    data = data)
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}
\examples{
# Add motion parameters as covariates
motion_data <- data.frame(
  x = rnorm(100),  # x translation
  y = rnorm(100)   # y translation
)
cv <- covariate(x, y, data = motion_data, prefix = "motion")

# Combine with event model
sframe <- sampling_frame(blocklens = c(100), TR = 2)
event_data <- data.frame(
  stimulus = factor(rep(c("A", "B"), 50)),
  onset = seq(0, 198, by = 4)
)

# Full model with both HRF-convolved events and non-convolved covariates
model <- event_model(
  signal ~ hrf(stimulus) + covariate(x, y),
  data = event_data,
  sampling_frame = sframe
)

}
