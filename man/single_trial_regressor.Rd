\title{Create a single trial regressor}
\usage{
single_trial_regressor(
  onsets,
  hrf = HRF_SPMG1,
  duration = 0,
  amplitude = 1,
  span = 24
)
}
\arguments{
\item{onsets}{the event onset in seconds, must be of length 1.}

\item{hrf}{a hemodynamic response function, e.g. \code{HRF_SPMG1}}

\item{duration}{duration of the event (default is 0)}

\item{amplitude}{scaling vector (default is 1)}

\item{span}{the temporal window of the impulse response function (default is 24)}
}
\value{
A single_trial_regressor object which inherits from regressor with the following components:
\itemize{
\item onsets: The onset time of the trial
\item duration: The duration of the trial
\item amplitude: The amplitude of the trial response
\item hrf: The HRF object used for convolution
}
}
\description{
Creates a regressor object for modeling a single trial event in an fMRI experiment.
This is particularly useful for trial-wise analyses where each trial needs to be
modeled separately. The regressor represents the predicted BOLD response for a single
event using a specified hemodynamic response function (HRF).

\examples{
# Create a single trial regressor with default HRF
reg <- single_trial_regressor(c(10), HRF_SPMG1)

# Create a single trial regressor with custom HRF and amplitude
reg <- single_trial_regressor(c(10), HRF_GAMMA, amplitude = 2)

# Evaluate the regressor over a time grid
grid <- seq(0, 30, by = 0.5)
values <- evaluate(reg, grid)
