\title{Create a single trial regressor}
\usage{
single_trial_regressor(
  onsets,
  hrf = HRF_SPMG1,
  duration = 0,
  amplitude = 1,
  span = 24
)
}
\arguments{
\item{onsets}{the event onset in seconds, must be of length 1.}

\item{hrf}{a hemodynamic response function, e.g. \code{HRF_SPMG1}}

\item{duration}{duration of the event (default is 0), must be length 1.}

\item{amplitude}{scaling vector (default is 1), must be length 1.}

\item{span}{the temporal window of the impulse response function (default is 24).}
}
\value{
A \code{Reg} object (inheriting from \code{regressor} and \code{list}).
}
\description{
Creates a regressor object for modeling a single trial event in an fMRI experiment.
This is particularly useful for trial-wise analyses where each trial needs to be
modeled separately. The regressor represents the predicted BOLD response for a single
event using a specified hemodynamic response function (HRF).
}
\details{
This is a convenience wrapper around \code{regressor} that ensures inputs have length 1.
