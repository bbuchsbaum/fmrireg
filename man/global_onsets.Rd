\title{Return the global onsets of an object}
\usage{
global_onsets(x, onsets, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The object containing timing information (typically a sampling_frame)}

\item{onsets}{A numeric vector of relative onset times within each run/block}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods. Common arguments include:
\describe{
\item{blockids}{Numeric vector specifying which block/run each onset belongs to}
\item{TR}{Numeric; repetition time in seconds}
}}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of global onset times where:
\itemize{
\item Each onset is adjusted by the cumulative duration of previous runs
\item Times are in the same units as the input onsets (typically seconds)
\item NA is returned for onsets that exceed their block duration
}
}
\description{
Convert relative onset times to global (cumulative) onset times across runs. Global onsets
are defined as cumulative time over runs, meaning they do not reset to zero for each run.
This is useful for:
\itemize{
\item Converting run-specific onsets to experiment-wide timings
\item Aligning events across multiple runs
\item Computing temporal distances between events in different runs
}
}
\examples{
# Create a sampling frame with three runs
sframe <- sampling_frame(
  blocklens = c(100, 100, 100),  # 100 scans per run
  TR = 2                         # 2 seconds per scan
)

# Define events in each run
run_onsets <- c(10, 20, 30)     # Events at 10s, 20s, 30s
run_ids <- c(1, 2, 3)           # One event per run

# Convert to global onsets
global_times <- global_onsets(
  sframe,
  onsets = run_onsets,
  blockids = run_ids
)
# Returns: c(10, 220, 430)
# Because:
#  - Run 1: 10s
#  - Run 2: 20s + (100 scans * 2s) = 220s
#  - Run 3: 30s + (200 scans * 2s) = 430s
