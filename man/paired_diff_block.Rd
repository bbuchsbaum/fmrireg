\usage{
paired_diff_block(blkA, blkB, rho = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{blkA}{First group_data block}

\item{blkB}{Second group_data block}

\item{rho}{Optional within-subject correlation between A and B. Can be:
\itemize{
\item Scalar: Same correlation for all subjects and features
\item Vector of length S: Per-subject correlations
\item Vector of length P: Per-feature correlations
\item Matrix (S x P): Subject-feature specific correlations
}
Default is 0 (independence).}
}
\value{
A new block with Y = Y_A - Y_B and propagated variance if available
}
\description{
Support functions for paired differences, sign flipping, and wrapper functions
for OLS and meta-analysis with voxelwise covariates.
Compute Paired Within-Subject Differences
}
\details{
Creates within-subject differences (A - B) for paired t-tests from two blocks
with identical subjects and features.
