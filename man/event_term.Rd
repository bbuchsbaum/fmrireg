\title{Create an event model term from a named list of variables.}
\usage{
event_term(evlist, onsets, blockids, durations = 1, subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{evlist}{A list of named variables.}

\item{onsets}{Numeric vector of onset times (in seconds).}

\item{blockids}{Numeric vector of block numbers.}

\item{durations}{Numeric vector of event durations (default is 1).}

\item{subset}{Logical vector indicating which onsets to retain (default is NULL).}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item varname: concatenated variable names,
\item events: a list of event objects,
\item subset: the retained onsets,
\item event_table: a tibble with event information,
\item onsets, blockids, durations.
}
}
\description{
Generates an event model term from a list of named variables along with their
onsets, block IDs, and durations. Optionally, a subset of onsets can be retained.
}
\examples{
x1 <- factor(rep(letters[1:3], 10))
x2 <- factor(rep(1:3, each = 10))
eterm <- event_term(list(x1 = x1, x2 = x2),
                    onsets = seq(1, 100, length.out = 30),
                    blockids = rep(1, 30))
