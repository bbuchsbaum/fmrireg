\title{Create an event model term from a named list of variables.}
\usage{
event_term(evlist, onsets, blockids, durations = 0, subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{evlist}{A named list of variables (factors, numeric, matrices, ParametricBasis objects).
The names are used as variable identifiers within the term.}

\item{onsets}{Numeric vector of onset times (in seconds).}

\item{blockids}{Numeric vector of block numbers (non-decreasing integers).}

\item{durations}{Numeric vector of event durations (seconds, default is 0).
Can be scalar (recycled) or vector matching length of \code{onsets}.}

\item{subset}{Optional logical vector indicating which events to retain (applied before processing).}
}
\value{
A list object with class \code{c("event_term", "event_seq")}. Contains:
\item{varname}{Concatenated variable names from \code{evlist}.}
\item{events}{A named list of the processed \code{event} objects.}
\item{subset}{The \code{subset} vector used.}
\item{event_table}{A tibble representing the combinations of descriptive levels/names
for each event in the term, constructed using \code{elements(..., values=FALSE)}.}
\item{onsets}{Numeric vector of onsets (after processing/subsetting).}
\item{blockids}{Numeric vector of block IDs (after processing/subsetting).}
\item{durations}{Numeric vector of durations (after processing/subsetting).}
}
\description{
Generates an \code{event_term} object which represents the combination of one
or more event sequences (e.g., a factor crossed with a numeric modulator).
It takes a list of variables (factors, numeric vectors, matrices, basis objects)
along with shared onsets, block IDs, and durations.
It uses the \code{EV} factory internally to create standardized \code{event} objects for each variable.

\examples{
x1 <- factor(rep(letters[1:3], 10))
x2 <- factor(rep(1:3, each = 10))
onsets <- seq(1, 100, length.out = 30)
blockids <- rep(1:3, each = 10)

eterm <- event_term(list(Condition = x1, Group = x2),
                    onsets = onsets,
                    blockids = blockids)
