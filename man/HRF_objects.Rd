\usage{
HRF_GAMMA(t, shape = 6, rate = 1)

HRF_GAUSSIAN(t, mean = 6, sd = 2)

HRF_SPMG1(t, P1 = 5, P2 = 15, A1 = 0.0833)

HRF_SPMG2(t)

HRF_SPMG3(t)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{Numeric vector of time points (in seconds) at which to evaluate the HRF}

\item{shape, rate}{Parameters for gamma distribution HRF (default: shape=6, rate=1)}

\item{mean, sd}{Parameters for Gaussian HRF (default: mean=6, sd=2)}

\item{P1, P2}{Shape parameters for SPM canonical HRF (default: P1=5, P2=15)}

\item{A1}{Amplitude parameter for SPM canonical HRF (default: 0.0833)}
}
\value{
When called as functions, return numeric vectors or matrices of HRF values.
When used as objects, they are HRF objects with class \code{c("HRF", "function")}.
}
\description{
A collection of pre-defined HRF objects for common fMRI analysis scenarios.
These objects can be used directly in model specifications or as templates
for creating custom HRFs.

\section{Canonical HRFs}{

\describe{
\item{\code{HRF_SPMG1}}{SPM canonical HRF (single basis function)}
\item{\code{HRF_SPMG2}}{SPM canonical HRF with temporal derivative (2 basis functions)}
\item{\code{HRF_SPMG3}}{SPM canonical HRF with temporal and dispersion derivatives (3 basis functions)}
\item{\code{HRF_GAMMA}}{Gamma function-based HRF}
\item{\code{HRF_GAUSSIAN}}{Gaussian function-based HRF}

\section{Flexible Basis Sets}{

\describe{
\item{\code{HRF_BSPLINE}}{B-spline basis HRF (5 basis functions)}
\item{\code{HRF_FIR}}{Finite Impulse Response (FIR) basis HRF (default 12 basis functions)}
}
}

\section{Usage}{

All HRF objects can be:
\itemize{
\item Called as functions with time argument: \code{HRF_SPMG1(t)}
\item Used in model specifications: \code{hrf(condition, basis = HRF_SPMG1)}
\item Evaluated with \code{evaluate()} method
\item Combined with decorators like \code{lag_hrf()} or \code{block_hrf()}
}
