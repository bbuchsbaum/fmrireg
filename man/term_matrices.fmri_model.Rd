\title{Extract Term Matrices from an fMRI Model}
\usage{
\method{term_matrices}{fmri_model}(x, blocknum = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{fmri_model} object containing the event and baseline models.}

\item{blocknum}{(Optional) A numeric vector specifying the block numbers to include. Defaults to all blocks.}
}
\value{
A named list of term matrices, with event terms followed by baseline terms.
Attributes \code{"event_term_indices"} and \code{"baseline_term_indices"} store the indices of event and baseline terms,
\code{"blocknum"} stores the block numbers, and \code{"varnames"} stores the variable names.
}
\description{
This function extracts the term matrices from an \code{fmri_model}, which consists of event-related terms
and baseline-related terms. These matrices are used to build the design matrix in fMRI data analysis.
