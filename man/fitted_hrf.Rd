\title{fitted_hrf}
\usage{
fitted_hrf(x, sample_at, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object for which the fitted HRF should be computed}

\item{sample_at}{A vector of time points at which the HRF should be sampled}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the fitted HRF values at the requested time points
}
\description{
Compute and return the fitted hemodynamic response function (HRF) for a model object.
The HRF represents the expected BOLD response to neural activity. For models with
multiple basis functions, this returns the combined HRF shape.
}
\details{
This generic function computes the fitted hemodynamic response function (HRF) for an object.
The method needs to be implemented for specific object types.

\examples{
# Create a simple dataset with two conditions
X <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 100), 100, 100)  # 100 timepoints, 100 voxels
event_data <- data.frame(
  condition = factor(c("A", "B", "A", "B")),
  onsets = c(1, 25, 50, 75),
  run = c(1, 1, 1, 1)
)

# Create dataset and sampling frame
dset <- matrix_dataset(X, TR = 2, run_length = 100, event_table = event_data)
sframe <- sampling_frame(blocklens = 100, TR = 2)

# Create event model with canonical HRF
evmodel <- event_model(
  onsets ~ hrf(condition),
  data = event_data,
  block = ~run,
  sampling_frame = sframe
)

# Fit model
fit <- fmri_lm(
  onsets ~ hrf(condition),
  block = ~run,
  dataset = dset
)

# Get fitted HRF at specific timepoints
times <- seq(0, 20, by = 0.5)  # Sample from 0-20s every 0.5s
hrf_values <- fitted_hrf(fit, sample_at = times)
