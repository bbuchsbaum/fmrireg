\usage{
regressor(
  onsets,
  hrf = HRF_SPMG1,
  duration = 0,
  amplitude = 1,
  span = 40,
  summate = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{onsets}{A numeric vector of event onset times in seconds.}

\item{hrf}{The hemodynamic response function (HRF) to convolve with the events.
This can be a pre-defined \code{HRF} object (e.g., \code{HRF_SPMG1}), a custom \code{HRF}
object created with \code{as_hrf}, a function \code{f(t)}, or a character string
referring to a known HRF type (e.g., "spmg1", "gaussian"). Defaults to \code{HRF_SPMG1}.}

\item{duration}{A numeric scalar or vector specifying the duration of each event
in seconds. If scalar, it's applied to all events. Defaults to 0 (impulse events).}

\item{amplitude}{A numeric scalar or vector specifying the amplitude (scaling factor)
for each event. If scalar, it's applied to all events. Defaults to 1.}

\item{span}{The temporal window (in seconds) over which the HRF is defined
or evaluated. This influences the length of the convolution. If not provided,
it may be inferred from the \code{hrf} object or default to 40s. \strong{Note:} Unlike some
previous versions, the \code{span} is not automatically adjusted based on \code{duration};
ensure the provided or inferred \code{span} is sufficient for your longest event duration.}

\item{summate}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default), the HRF response amplitude scales
with the duration of sustained events (via internal convolution/summation). If \code{FALSE},
the response reflects the peak HRF reached during the event duration.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{Reg} and \code{list}
containing processed event information and the HRF specification.
}
\description{
Creates an object representing event-related regressors for fMRI modeling.
This function defines event onsets and associates them with a hemodynamic
response function (HRF) to generate predicted time courses.
}
\details{
This function serves as the main public interface for creating regressor objects.
Internally, it utilizes the \code{Reg()} constructor which performs validation and
efficient storage. The resulting object can be evaluated at specific time points
using the \code{evaluate()} function.

Events with an amplitude of 0 or NA are automatically filtered out.
