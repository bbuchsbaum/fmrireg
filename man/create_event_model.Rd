\title{Create an event model directly from components.}
\usage{
create_event_model(
  event_terms,
  events,
  onsets,
  block,
  sampling_frame,
  durations = 0,
  drop_empty = TRUE,
  precision = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{event_terms}{A list of event term specifications. Each term is a list with components:
- \code{variables}: Character vector of variable names or expressions.
- \code{hrf}: HRF specification for the term.}

\item{events}{A data frame of event variables (all variables must be present).}

\item{onsets}{A numeric vector of event onset times (in seconds).}

\item{block}{A vector of block IDs (must be strictly increasing integers).}

\item{sampling_frame}{The time series grid over which to sample the function.}

\item{durations}{A numeric vector of event durations (default is 0 for all events).}

\item{drop_empty}{Logical indicating whether to drop empty events (default is TRUE).}

\item{precision}{Numeric value indicating the precision of HRF sampling (default is 0.3).}
}
\value{
An event_model object.
}
\description{
Constructs an event model from its components. Variables can be specified as
character strings or expressions (captured using rlang::exprs). The function creates
HRF specifications (hrfspec objects), builds a formula string, and then assembles
the final event model.
}
\examples{

# Example with variables as character strings:
event_terms <- list(
  list(
    variables = c("x", "y"),
    hrf = "spmg1"
  )
)

# Example with variables as expressions:
event_terms <- list(
  list(
    variables = exprs(x, Poly(y, 2)),
    hrf = "spmg1"
  )
)

}
