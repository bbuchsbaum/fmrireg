\title{Create a continuous event set from a matrix.}
\usage{
event_matrix(mat, name, onsets, blockids = 1, durations = 0, subset = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A numeric matrix of continuous event values (one row per event).}

\item{name}{Name of the event variable.}

\item{onsets}{Numeric vector of event onsets (seconds).}

\item{blockids}{Numeric vector of block IDs.}

\item{durations}{Numeric vector of event durations (seconds), or a scalar.}

\item{subset}{Optional logical vector indicating which events to keep. If
provided, the vector must match \code{onsets} in length and contain no \code{NA}
values.

If \code{mat} has column names and more than one column, those names are
sanitized using \code{.sanitizeName()} before being stored. The sanitized
column names are returned by \code{levels()} for the resulting event object.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{event} and \code{event_seq}.
}
\description{
This is a user-facing wrapper around the internal \code{event()} constructor,
specifically for creating continuous event sequences from numeric matrices.
}
\examples{
mat <- matrix(rnorm(20), 10, 2, dimnames=list(NULL, c("Val1", "Val2")))
onsets <- seq(1, 100, length.out = 10)
durations <- rep(1, 10)
blockids <- rep(1, 10)
eset <- event_matrix(mat, "eset", onsets, blockids, durations)
print(eset)
columns(eset) # Alias for levels
