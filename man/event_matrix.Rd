\title{Create a continuous valued event set from a matrix}
\usage{
event_matrix(mat, name, onsets, blockids = rep(1, ncol(mat)), durations = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A matrix of continuous event sequence values, with one row per event}

\item{name}{A character string providing a name for the event set}

\item{onsets}{A numeric vector of onsets for each event in the sequence}

\item{blockids}{A numeric vector of block identifiers for each event in the sequence (default: 1)}

\item{durations}{A numeric vector of durations for each event in the sequence (default: NULL)}
}
\value{
An object representing the continuous valued event set, with class "event_matrix" and "event_seq"
}
\description{
This function generates a continuous valued event set object from a given matrix.
It is useful for creating event sequences with multiple continuous predictors for fMRI data analyses.
}
\examples{
mat <- matrix(rnorm(200), 100, 2)
onsets <- seq(1, 1000, length.out=100)
durations <- rep(1, 100)
blockids <- rep(1, 100)

eset <- event_matrix(mat, "eset", onsets, durations, blockids)
